"""Log/eval cadence that cannot drift apart.

Gating evals inside the periodic-logging branch silently skips them whenever
``eval_every_steps`` isn't a multiple of ``log_every_steps``. This helper
ties the two cadences together: logging always fires on eval steps, so an
eval can never be computed without being logged or skipped by misalignment.
