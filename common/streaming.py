"""Streaming-dataset plumbing for generated (synthetic) data.

The same class of validity bug kept recurring in per-experiment streaming
implementations:

- DataLoader workers duplicating data: every worker iterates its own copy of
  an IterableDataset, so without a worker-id offset they all yield the same
  stream.
- Stale data across epochs: re-iterating with a seed that ignores the epoch
  counter repeats the previous epoch's data.

Use :class:`SyntheticStream` instead of writing a new IterableDataset from
scratch.

This is the generated-data half of the monorepo's ``shared/streaming.py``;
the HuggingFace-text-corpus half is unused here and was dropped.

    Handles the validity-critical plumbing once:

    - mixes the DataLoader worker id into the seed so workers don't yield
      duplicate examples
    - shards ``n_examples`` across workers so one pass over the DataLoader
      yields exactly ``n_examples`` examples in total
    - mixes the epoch counter into the seed so re-iterating yields fresh data

    Subclasses implement :meth:`generate`.

    The automatic epoch counter only advances with ``num_workers=0`` or
    ``persistent_workers=True`` (otherwise each epoch re-forks workers from
    the parent copy, whose counter never advanced). Prefer single-epoch
    streaming (``--n-epochs 1`` with a larger ``n_examples``);
    for genuine multi-epoch use with non-persistent workers, call
    :meth:`set_epoch` before each epoch like a DistributedSampler.

    Note the epoch advances at the *start* of every iteration — unlike
    :class:`PackedTextStream`, which advances only on full consumption — so
    even a partial pass yields fresh data next time. Don't use an instance as
    a repeatedly-iterated val set expecting deterministic evals; materialize a
    fixed eval batch (or call :meth:`set_epoch` with a constant) instead.
